    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <div class = "Me">
    <p>My name is Nate Anderson! I was a pre-med student gunning to be a doctor. I soon realized that while being a doctor was possible I did not have the drive to become one for the rest of my life. I decided to go on a seach of who I am as a person and my own interests.
    </p>

    <p>I searched long and hard. Eventually I found that I had a particular interest in computors. I had always wondered how they worked and what makes games, websites, and all the tech in my life tick. I eventually learned about coding and decided this was the path I needed to take.</p>

    <p>So far all I have found is excitement as I have participated in this awesome bootcamp from Devmountain!</p>
